# A Cheat Sheet Handbook

Through this skill, we hope to provide cheat sheets of a few softwares. When you are immersed in your work but cannot recall what a keyboard shortcut is, it's very bothering to change to the web browser and search for the shortcut of the corresponding function --- even if it's easy to find. Also, we hope to add support of some code snippets which are long, frequently used and boring. It will be a lot faster when you can just access these snippets through cortana instead of analyzing results returned by the search engine.

# Several examples of user scenarios
